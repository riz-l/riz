            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              I am a website/application developer at DXC Technology, working
              primarily in ReactJS, HTML, CSS and JS. I also work with Team
              Defence Information (TDI) as a Mobile Application Adoption in
              Defence co-lead in the Joint Information Group - Vanguard (JIG-V).

              I am currently looking for opportunities to further my career
              either through new employment or in contributing towards active
              projects.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              After completing an MA in International Relations at the
              University of Nottingham, I joined DXC Technology's UK Healthcare
              branch through their graduate scheme. Though I obviously had (and
              still have!) a huge interest in international relations, whether
              that's state security, terrorism studies or politics, I took an
              immediate interest in working within the STEM industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortly after joining DXC Technology I self-taught HTML, CSS and
              JS to become involved in Offering Delivery and Transformation
              (OD&amp;T). The thought of turning concepts into workable code,
              and even further - working applications and software - fascinated
              me.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my day job I work on an application developed to be used by
              ambulance crews on tablets whilst attending emergency incidents.
              This mostly involves coding in ReactJS daily, as well as Azure
              cloud database integration and SQL. In my spare time, I am a
              Mobile Application Adoption in Defence co-lead in TDI's JIG-V.
              This involves assisting with policy advice, mobile application
              guidance and also developing small-scale projects such as the
              'Acronym Search'.

              I love all things PC and mechanical keyboards, I just wish I could
              afford to facilitate my love. I'm also a huge Real Madrid fan and
              I love to play video games!
