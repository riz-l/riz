              Defence Information (TDI) as a Mobile Application Adoption in

              I am currently looking for opportunities to further my career

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              After completing an MA in International Relations at the
              University of Nottingham, I joined DXC Technology's UK Healthcare
              branch through their graduate scheme. Though I obviously had (and
              still have!) a huge interest in international relations, whether
              that's state security, terrorism studies or theory, I took an
              immediate interest in working within the STEM industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortly after joining DXC Technology I self-taught HTML, CSS and
              JS to become involved in Offering Delivery and Transformation
              (OD&amp;T). The thought of turning concepts into workable code,
              and even further - working applications and software - fascinated
              me.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my day job I work on an application used by ambulance crews on
              tablets whilst attending emergency incidents. This mostly involves
              coding in React JS daily, as well as Azure cloud database
              integration and SQL. In my spare time, I am a Mobile Application
              Adoption in Defence co-lead in{" "}
              <span title="Team Defence Information">TDI</span>'s{" "}
              <span title="Joint Information Group - Vanguard">JIG-V</span>.
              This involves assisting with policy advice, mobile application
              guidance and also developing small-scale projects such as the
              'Acronym Search'.
